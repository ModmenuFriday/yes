:dad:Woooo! What a rush! My head is still buzzing!
:dad:Looks like I lost, but to be honest, I don't really care.
:dad:It's just nice to have some visitors. The TV world can get pretty lonely, you know?
:dad:...
:dad:Say, what's it like, living out there in the real world? 
:dad:I've only ever watched from the outside, so I've always wondered what it's like.
:bf:Skebeep bop!
:dad:Ha! You know I still can't understand a word of what you're saying, dude.
:dad:But you seem happy. It must be pretty great, huh?
:dad:Maybe one day, I can...
:bf:...Bebop?
:dad:...No, that's a silly thought. 
:dad:When they put me in here, they said I was defective. 
:dad:A defective bot like me doesn't belong on the outside.
:dad:Still, it sounds like a cool place! You two must miss it already, huh?
:bf:Skebeep badoobap!
:dad:Ha! You said it, dude! Man, I'm gonna miss you guys. 
:dad:But while you're still here, how about another battle?
:bf:Beep bo bop!
:dad:Alright! You're on!
