:dad:Hey you two! Been a while, huh?
:bf:beep!
:dad:This world you live in is absolutely crazy, you know that?
:dad:I've done so many new things since I got here... Made so many new friends!
:dad:So many new places I've explored!
:dad:I even touched that green thing in the ground for the first time!
:dad:I think it was called "grass" or something like that. But like I was saying-
:dad:The world is so much more beautiful in person, dude. 
:dad:I've got you to thank for bringing me out to see it.
:dad:So... thanks, you two. <3
:dad:Hey, how did you wind up walking into the TV world anyways?
:bf:bebeep!
:dad:Heh! I guess it doesn't matter anyways.
:dad:But it was fun getting to jam out with you back then, yeah?
:dad:What do you say? Down for one more round?
:bf:Skebeep bop!
