:dad:Oh my god, that actually worked!
:bf:Beebaibap!
:dad:High five dude! It looks like it's just strong enough for the two of you!
:dad:Now go, before it closes! I don't know how long that'll hold!
:bf:...
:dad:...Well? Go! You two gotta get back home, right?!
:bf:Boop beep
:dad:What are you saying, dude? I still can't understand you.
:bf:Boop. Beep.
:dad:...
:dad:You two are crazy, you know that?
:dad:If I go now, there's no turning back. It's a one way trip. 
:dad:I haven't been out there in years- no, decades! 
:dad:Everything would be new and alien! 
:dad:Would I even belong in a place like that? A defective robot like me?
:bf:Skedoop bebap!
:dad:...
:dad:...Heh. You have a strange way with words, funky little dude.
:dad:Maybe the outside world is worth giving a shot after all.
:dad:Let's get outta here!
