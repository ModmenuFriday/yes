:bf:Beebobeep?!
:dad:Sh-Sh-Sh-Sheesh, my h-h-head- You good, dude!?
:bf:Bobai!
:dad:This was a bad idea. This place wasn't meant to handle more than just me!
:dad:I'm detecting an unhealthy amount of distortion from everything around us!
:dad:It's completely overwhelmed... This is bad, dude. You g-gotta get out of here, ASAP!
:dad:Good thing we're not too far. Our little rap battle activated the doorway.
:dad:That glowing green screen in the center... That's your way out! 
:dad:It looks like it's barely strong enough to pull one living person out, but...
:dad:I have a feeling neither of you would want to go through without the other.
:bf:Bope.
:dad:That's what I thought. You seemed like the ride or die type anyways.
:dad:In that case... If our song opened it up, maybe it can make it stronger, too!
:dad:Get ready to sing your gears out, B.F.! Give it everything you've got!
:bf:Beep bo bop!
